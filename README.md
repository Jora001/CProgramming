C Programming Exercises
This repository includes fundamental exercises I have completed in the C programming language. Each exercise is designed to strengthen various programming skills.

My Completed Exercises
c00 - ft_putchar
I wrote a function that prints a single character. This exercise helped me learn how to create functions and work with the write() system call.

c01 - ft_putchar_alphabet
I implemented a function that prints all the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet in order. This exercise provided an opportunity to explore loops and ASCII values.

c02 - ft_putchar_reverse_alphabet
I wrote a function that prints all the lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet in reverse order. The goal was to understand the logic of reversed strings.

c03 - ft_print_numbers
A function that prints numbers (0-9) sequentially. This exercise helped me understand the principles of converting between numbers and characters.

c04 - ft_is_negative
I implemented a function that checks a given number and prints N (negative) or P (positive). This exercise allowed me to develop skills in conditional statements.

c05 - ft_print_comb
I wrote a function that prints all possible combinations of three different digits in ascending order. This exercise deepened my understanding of complex loops and logic.

c06 - ft_print_comb2
I implemented a function that prints all possible combinations of two 2-digit numbers (00-99). This exercise helped me work with advanced combinatorics and number formatting.

Completing these exercises has not only solidified my foundational programming knowledge but also provided valuable experience that will help me tackle more complex projects in the future.
